  <h1>Seele is a quantum main dps unit who follows the path of the hunt</h1>
  <h2>Seele is a hypercarry unit, which means that it is recommended to build a team around her damage output</h2>
  <h3>Her best in slot relics are:
    4pc quantum set, 2pc quantum and 2pc wild wheat.<br> As for planar ornaments, Herta Space Station and Salssoto have
    similar performance, but Rutilant Arena is the best if you reach the 70% crit rate requirement.
    Note that in the next versions we are going to get a new ornament from Penaconny, the new one should be her best one
    due to the speed requirement instead of crit rate.</h3>
  <h2>For the lightcones, her best in slot is "In the Night," her signature lightcone </h2>

  <h1>Seele's kit</h1>
  <h2>Basic ATK: Thwack</h2>
